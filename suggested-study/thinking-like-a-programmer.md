## 4. Thinking like a programmer III

As our applications grow bigger, they increase in complexity. This can make our programs harder to understand. In order to make things as clear and easy to understand as possible, we need to regularly tidy up our code. In the industry we call this act `refactoring`. The result of this is what we like to call `clean code`.

As a great programmer, you always want to be writing clean code. This means: code that's well-organized in small files that you can easily read and understand in order to comprehend what the application is trying to do.

There are many ways to write clean code. Some of them you might have heard: Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) or Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS) are two things to keep in mind. There are many others and you are encouraged to do your own research!

Here are already a couple of them to get you started:
