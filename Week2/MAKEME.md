# Homework Using API's Week 2

## **Todo list**

1. Practice the concepts
2. Refactor project

## **1. Practice the concepts**

Let's start this week off with some interactive exercises! Visit the following link to get started:

- [Learn JavaScript: Promises](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript/modules/javascript-promises)

## **2. Refactor Project**

In this weeks `code along` you'll be building a Bookmarker application. It'll allow a user to add in URLs of their favorite websites in order to save it into a list. After you've completed the tutorial you will write a development strategy and refactor the code into a full project structure. Your final repo should:

- use `import`/`export`
- use `async`/`await`
- have development strategy
- use branches & PRs to organize your development
- have at least one more user story than the final code of the tutorial

Happy learning!
