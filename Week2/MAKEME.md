## **3. Homework exercises**

This week we expect you to do the exercises in the corresponding module/week folder (Using API's / Week 2). Have a look at your class repository on how to hand in the homework.

## **4. Extra: Code along**

If you are done and want to practice some more, the following code along implements a GitHub profile finder using the GitHub API.

He uses some things that will be new for you:
- `scss` - This is what is called a css precompiler that adds some functionality to your css. `sass` is another version of this. Some projects use these, some do not. It is not necessary to know what this does specifically.
- `package.json` commands with the `live server` extension. This is a way to set up a project, don't worry too much about understanding exactly how it works

## Done early?

Have a look at the project for next week and start thinking of ideas. You can even start a bit already if you wish, just remember to make sure all your homework is done beforehand!
