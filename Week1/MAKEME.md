# Homework Using API's Week 1

## **Todo list**

1. Practice the concepts
2. Homework exercises

## **1. Practice the concepts**

This week is tough, asynchronous coding is another one of these programming things that takes awhile to get your head around. Let's start this week off with some interactive exercises! Visit the following link to get started:

- [Learn JavaScript: Promises](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-intermediate-javascript/modules/javascript-promises). _Note that the last exercise is not necessary, it is very complicated and something that is rarely used. You will not need to be able to do this. See it as a challenge!_
- [JavaScript promises, mastering the asynchronous](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/347/javascript-promises-mastering-the-asynchronous/what-is-asynchronous-in-javascript)

## **2. Homework exercises**

This week we expect you to do the exercises in the corresponding module/week folder (Using API's / Week 1). Have a look at the [homework guide](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/UsingAPIs/blob/main/homework-handin-guide.md) to see how to hand in your homework.

*NOTE: do NOT forget to checkout the main branch before creating the branch for this week. Otherwise your previous homework will be a part of the PR*

## Done early?

Have a look at the material for next week!
