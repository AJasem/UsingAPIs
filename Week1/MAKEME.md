# Homework Using API's Week 1

## **Todo list**

1. Practice the concepts
2. Refactor Project

## **1. Practice the concepts**

This week's concepts can be challenging, therefore let's get an easy introduction using some interactive exercises! Check the following resources out and start practicing:

- [Learn JavaScript: Requests](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript/modules/intermediate-javascript-requests)

## **2. Refactor Project**

In the following "code along" you'll be building a complete Weather App that makes use of the [Darksky API](https://darksky.net). After you've completed the tutorial you will write a development strategy and refactor the code into a full project structure. Your final repo should:

- use `import`/`export`
- have development strategy
- use branches & PRs to organize your development
- have at least one more user story than the final code of the tutorial

Enjoy!
