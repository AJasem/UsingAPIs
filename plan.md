# WIP-Using-APIS

This is a work in progress repo for a proposal for a using API's module. This is under construction, if you are a student at HackYourFuture you are probably looking in the wrong place. Please check out the [curriculum here](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/curriculum).

## Structure

In the following table you can find the basic structure:

| Week | Topics                                                | Get started link |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1    | Synchronous vs Asynchronous code, Callbacks, Closures | TODO             |
| 2    | API's, Promises, Fetch, Async/await                   | TODO             |
| 3    | Individual project + Interview as test                | TODO             |

## Project Suggestion

Create a boilerplate repo for all the projects in this module. if you want to avoid students finding each others' forks, you can have them clone or generate from template instead. The project starter should use `import`/`export` and have an opinionated separation of concerns. I'd suggest doing something similar to the project structure they learned in the last module (if you decide to stick with my proposals that would be the [javascript-30-starter](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/javascript-30-starter)). Students will then have 2 weeks practice building async projects in this structure before being asked to build an open-ended project in the third week.

This suggestion doesn't mean you can't use the projects and requirements from JS3, it just means that you give students a starter repo to build it in.
